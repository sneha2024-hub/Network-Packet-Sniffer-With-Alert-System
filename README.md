# Network-Packet-Sniffer-With-Alert-System
A Python-based network packet sniffer captures, analyzes, and logs live network traffic using Scapy. The tool detects potential network issues like packet floods or scans and saves them in a local SQLite database. It has a Tkinter-based GUI for real-time monitoring, filtering packets, and exporting captured data in CSV or HTML format.
